# Manage Your SCSS files !

To improve the management of your SCSS files you can split them into several other small files that will be gathered in a main file, style.scss.
It is therefore easier to write and to maintain your css file.

To create your css file, simply use the scss compiler on the main file.

Please, do not hesitate to suggest your ideas.
